![Build](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bytewords-cli/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

## Introduction

This repo contains `bytewords`, a command line tool used to explore, test, and exercise Blockchain Commons' C reference implementation of the **Bytewords** encoding.

**NOTE:** In this document the Bytewords encoding method is referred to with a capitalized first letter, and the CLI tool `bytewords` is referred to in `code voice`.

Bytewords is a method for encoding arbitary binary data in plain text as a sequence of common four-letter English words. Bytewords defines exactly 256 such words, one for each possible combination of bits in a byte (octet).

Bytewords is useful, for example, when recording a cryptographic seed as a series of words engraved on permanent media such as a tungsten plate; a procedure common in the cryptocurrency community. Bytewords can be easily used in self-contained URIs, or shortened further to just the first and last letter of each word, which is comparable to hexadecimal but less prone to human transcription error. For error detection Bytewords also adds a CRC32 checksum.

The Bytewords encoding is detailed [here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md).

Bytewords is used to encode CBOR-structured binary as part of the specification for Uniform Resources (URs) defined [here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md).

## Status - First Testing Release

This release is feature complete and ready for testing.

## Dependencies

`bytewords` requires the following Blockchain Commons libraries:

* [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base)
* [`bc-bytewords`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-bytewords)

It also requires the following additional library:

* [`GNU argp`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html)

### Tool Dependencies

To build `seedtool` you'll need to use the following tools:

- autotools - Gnu Build System from Free Software Foundation ([intro](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)).

## Recommended Installation instructions

The dependencies will be automatically installed as submodules when you run the build script. This is the recommended way to install.

### Build on MacOS

```bash
$ brew install autoconf automake libtool shunit2
```

You must then download or clone this repo. Afterward, cd into the repo directory and:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

### Build on Linux

Make sure you have `llvm`/`clang`, `libc++` and `libc++abi` installed, all with
a minimum recommended version 10.

#### Build on Ubuntu and Debian

```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential

$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ sudo apt install lsb-release wget software-properties-common
$ sudo ./llvm.sh 10  # version 10

$ sudo apt-get install libc++-10-dev libc++abi-10-dev
```

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bytewords-cli.git
$ cd seedtool-cli/
$ export CC="clang-10" && export CXX="clang++-10" && ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

## Incremental Build Instructions

If you wish to make changes to the source code and rebuild:

```bash
# Make source changes
$ source set_build_paths.sh # sets shell variables used by make
$ make clean # If you want a clean build
$ make
```

## Usage

### Input and Output

`bytewords` can take its input from either the command line arguments or from STDIN.

Input on the command line. Note that the string provided explicitly encodes a newline character at the end.

```
$ bytewords $'Hello\n'
fund inch jazz jazz jowl back each mint epic calm
```

Input on the terminal via STDIN (`^D` represents Control-D (EOF)).

```
$ bytewords
Hello
^D
fund inch jazz jazz jowl back each mint epic calm
```

`bytewords` writes its output to STDOUT.

Input from a file and output back to another file:

```
$ cat >input.txt
Hello
^D

$ bytewords <input.txt >output.txt
$ cat output.txt
fund inch jazz jazz jowl back each mint epic calm
```

### Formats

The five possible input and output formats are:

|    |    |
|:---|:---|
| `standard` | Bytewords standard encoding
| `uri` | Bytewords URI-compatible encoding
| `minimal` | Bytewords minimal encoding
| `bin` | Binary
| `hex` | Hexadecimal

By default `bytewords` takes binary data as input and encodes it in the "standard" Bytewords format. This is as if you typed:

```
bytewords -i bin -o standard ...
```

### Case

Input of textual formats to `bytewords` is case-insensitive. Output of textual formats is lower case by default, but can be forced to upper case with the `--capitalize` option. No case conversion is ever performed on binary input or output data.

```
$ bytewords --capitalize $'Hello\n'
FUND INCH JAZZ JAZZ JOWL BACK EACH MINT EPIC CALM
```

`--capitalize` is ignored for binary output.

```
$ bytewords --capitalize -i standard -o bin FUND INCH JAZZ JAZZ JOWL BACK EACH MINT EPIC CALM
Hello
```

## Examples

Convert a string to the five output formats.

```
$ bytewords $'Hello\n'
fund inch jazz jazz jowl back each mint epic calm

$ bytewords -o uri $'Hello\n'
fund-inch-jazz-jazz-jowl-back-each-mint-epic-calm

$ bytewords -o minimal $'Hello\n'
fdihjzjzjlbkehmteccm

$ bytewords -o bin $'Hello\n'
Hello

$ bytewords -o hex $'Hello\n'
48656c6c6f0a
```

Convert the minimal encoding to the other output formats:

```
$ bytewords -i minimal fdihjzjzjlbkehmteccm
fund inch jazz jazz jowl back each mint epic calm

$ bytewords -i minimal -o uri fdihjzjzjlbkehmteccm
fund-inch-jazz-jazz-jowl-back-each-mint-epic-calm

$ bytewords -i minimal -o minimal fdihjzjzjlbkehmteccm
fdihjzjzjlbkehmteccm

$ bytewords -i minimal -o bin fdihjzjzjlbkehmteccm
Hello

$ bytewords -i minimal -o hex fdihjzjzjlbkehmteccm
48656c6c6f0a
```

Strings that are not well-formed Bytewords or where the CRC32 checksum does not match are rejected.

```
$ bytewords -i minimal -o hex fdihjzjzjlbkehmtecec
bytewords: Invalid Bytewords.
```

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ make lint
$ make distcheck
$ make distclean
```

`make lint` uses [Cppcheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cppcheck) to perform static analysis on the code. All PRs should pass with no warnings.
